# 🎓 CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python

**Completed by Aleena Elza Mathew**

This repository contains my completed problem sets, labs, and final project submissions from [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) — an entry-level course offered by Harvard University.

## 📚 Course Overview

CS50P introduces the foundations of computer science and programming using the Python language. Topics covered include:

- Variables and Data Types
- Conditionals and Loops
- Functions
- Exceptions
- File I/O
- Libraries and Packages
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Regular Expressions
- Web Programming with Flask
- Unit Testing

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing clean, efficient Python code
- Debugging and testing with `pytest`
- File handling and working with CSV, JSON
- Flask for basic web apps
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Thinking like a computer scientist!

## 🚀 Final Project

The final project is a culmination of everything learned in the course. It demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and document a complete Python application.

👉 Check out the ## TIC-TAC-TOE repo for the full project and instructions.
